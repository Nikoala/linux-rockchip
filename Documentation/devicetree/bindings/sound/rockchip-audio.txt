* Rockchip Audio controller

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible : "rk3036-audio"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
  clock-names property.
- clocks-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
  property. Must contain "rockchip-i2s" and "rk3036-codec".
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- dmas: list of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
- dma-names: identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
  These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.
- pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.
- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.
- pinctrl-1: pin control group to be used for gpio.

Example:

rockchip-audio {
	compatible = "rk3036-audio";
	dais {
		dai0 {
			audio-codec = <&codec>;
			i2s-controller = <&i2s>;
			format = "i2s";
			//continuous-clock;
			//bitclock-inversion;
			//frame-inversion;
			//bitclock-master;
			//frame-master;
		};
	};
};
